## üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Onyedikachi Ezema -- @kachi-cmd 
### Programmer | Azure Cloud Administrator  

Motivated and passionate about bringing ideas to life, I am proficient in data modelling, application development, and cross-team communication. In addition to my diverse skill set, I possess coding experience with python, pytorch, pandas, JavaScript, React.js, HTML, and CSS.
