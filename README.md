## üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Onyedikachi Ezema -- @kachi-cmd 
### I am an Agile Product Manager | Product Designer | Azure Cloud Administrator  

I am a junior Product Manager, Product Designer, and a certified Agile practitioner with extensive experience in diverse project management methodologies, including Scrum, Kanban, waterfall, and Agile. My skill set covers stakeholder communication, risk management, project scheduling, budgeting, market and competition research, user surveys, feasibility and viability analysis, prototyping, and milestone management.

Motivated and passionate about bringing ideas to life, I am proficient in product design, cross-team communication, and customer service. My expertise extends to finding creative solutions in customer relationship management (CRM), finance, real estate, and web development initiatives. I am a solution-driven individual experienced in solving complex problems and adept at managing supply-chain relationships, administrative contacts, and quickly learning new technologies.

Efficient at coaching and mentoring agile teams, I am well-versed in Agile methodologies and utilize tools like Jira for managing and tracking tasks and projects. Recognizing the importance of clear documentation, I employ Confluence to document processes and procedures, ensuring team members have a comprehensive understanding of tasks, processes, and deadlines.

In addition to my diverse skill set, I possess coding experience with JavaScript, React.js, HTML, and CSS. My proficiency in UI-UX involves leveraging Figma to create wireframes, technical user-flow diagrams, and aesthetically pleasing yet user-friendly GUIs/mock-ups. These skills enable me to effectively communicate technical tasks, issues, and project objectives to developers, relay feature progress to stakeholders, and facilitate the entire process of delivering a product within schedule.

As an IT specialist, I am captivated by the endless possibilities and applications Azure cloud computing offers in product design and development. In this pursuit, I have been developing skills in cloud computation and am now a Microsoft Azure Certified Cloud Administrator. I am committed to expanding my expertise and certifications to include Microsoft Azure Architect, so stay tuned (smiles).

My proficiency extends to various cloud technologies, including Azure Identity and Access Management (IAM), Azure DevOps, Azure Web-Apps, Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Azure Active Directory (AD), Azure Container Registry and Container Instance (ACR) & (ACI), Docker, Blob storage, File storage, Virtual Machines, Virtual Networks, and Azure Application Gateway.
